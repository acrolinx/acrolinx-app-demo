Content marketing. It’s one of the most important things that companies can do to build their brand, attract and retain loyal customers, and boost their bottom line. That’s why over the past decade or so, producing content has become firmly entrenched in commercial marketing efforts. Today, 91 percent of B2B businesses say they use content marketing.
And yet, only a third of those businesses think their organization has a robust, tactical approach to creating and distributing effective, targeted, and valuable content. So what gives?
At the heart of every successful content marketing effort is a sound and well-established content strategy. If you don’t have one and aren’t reaching your goals, that’s probably why. An effective content strategy should drive audience engagement, boost your brand, and provide a healthy return on your investment. To do this, you need to establish a strategy that sets out your goals and tactics, keeps you on target, and helps you measure your results.
Let’s look at the elements of a killer content strategy and some resources you can consult to help get you there.
